# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Alessandro Dalbesio. <br><br>
After having completed my bachelor's degree in Automation and Control Engineering at Polytechnic University of Milan I'm currently finishing my master's degree in robotics at Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) <br><br>
I'm passionate about deep learning, computer vision, and robotics and I'm always eager to learn new things!
## ðŸš€ Projects
Here you can find a list of some of the projects I have worked on or that I am currently working on.<br>
If you want to know more about them, feel free to contact me!<br><br>
<i>Note: </i> Here I will list only public project visible to all in my Github profile. Private projects I'm working on or I've worked on won't be in this list. <br>


### âœ… [Puzzle reordering](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/EPFL-image-analysis-and-pattern-recognition)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) <br>

The purpose of the project was to develop a pipeline that, given an image of pieces of puzzles randomly placed on a table, was able to detect, segment and cluster the pieces into the different puzzles.  <br><br>
You can find a small presentation, with the steps implemented and the different results, [here](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/EPFL-image-analysis-and-pattern-recognition/blob/main/Report.pdf).

### âœ… [Thymio navigation](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/EPFL-basics-of-mobile-robotics) 
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) <br>

The purpose of the project was to develop a pipeline such that a Thymio was able, given it's current position and the destination, to find the best path to reach the destination. <br>
As hardware we used a Thymio robot and an external webcam to detect the position of the robot (such as the current position and the destination but also the obstacles). <br><br>
You can find a visual representation of the results obtained [here](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/EPFL-basics-of-mobile-robotics/blob/main/README.md).

### âœ… [Rocket control with MPC techniques](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/EPFL-model-predictive-control)
![MATLAB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MATLAB-EC4C30?style=flat&logo=matlab&logoColor=white) <br>

The purpose of the project was to develop different model predictive controllers to control the trajectory of a rocket. 
 The following controllers have been implemented:
 - Linear MPC on a linear rocket model
 - Linear MPC on a non-linear rocket model
 - Non linear MPC on a non-linear rocket model 

 Additionally the rocket has been studied both with fuel consumption (to simulate an external disturbance) and control delay. <br><br>
 You can find the report for this project [here](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/EPFL-model-predictive-control/blob/master/report.pdf). <br><br>

### âœ… [QCNet on Unitraj](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/DLAV-project)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) <br>

The purpose of the project was to study the [UniTraj framework](https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj) and implement in it a chosen model. Here the [QCNet model](https://github.com/ZikangZhou/QCNet) has been implemented to control the trajectory of an autonomous vehicle. <br><br>
For this project no report is available, but you can find the code [here](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/DLAV-project).

### âœ… Mixed Reality Harvesting environemnt

![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479A1?style=flat&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

The purpose of the project was to create a mixed reality harvesting environment that let an user interact with a real system in a virtual environment. Additionally the user should have been able to select and upload different objects and choose between different colors. <br><br>
A full report explaining all the different components and the interactions between them can be found here: 
<br><br>
The repositories of the project are:
- [API Server](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/MRE-harvesting-API-server): Here there is the implementation of the API server whose purpose was to manage the non real time communication between the devices.
- [User Interface](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/MRE-harvesting-user-interface) Here there is the implementation of the user interface.
- [Websocket Server](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/MRE-harvesting-websocket-server): Here there is the implementation of the websocket server.
- [Adapted OptiTrack Python SDK](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/MRE-harvesting-MRE-optitrack-interface): Here there is a modification of the OptiTrack Python SDK to send data directly from the OptiTrack to the Unity Virtual Environment on the Oculus. This was needed due to the fact that the optitrack was behind a VPN whose software was not available on the Oculus Quest Pro.
- [Virtual Environment](https://github.com/alessandrodalbesio/MRE-harvesting-virtual-environment): Virtual environment in Unity. <br><br>
